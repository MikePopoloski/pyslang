# Contibuting to `pyslang`

Pyslang, the Python bindings for the [slang project](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang), are built, tested, and packaged with code in this repository. 

The bulk of functional code is in the [`slang` repository](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang). Please refer to its [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more information on contributing to the core project.

## Python Bindings

Python bindings are built using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Building and Testing

TODO: Write step-by-step instructions to build and test the bindings.
