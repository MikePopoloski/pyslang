# pyslang - Language bindings for slang, SystemVerilog parsing and compilation library

This used to be a separate packaging repository for the Python bindings of the [slang](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) SystemVerilog library. The packaging has since been moved to the upstream repo and so this one is obsolete. It will be left in archive form because old releases link to it in their readme.
